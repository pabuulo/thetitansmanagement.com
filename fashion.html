									<p>The Titans Management/TTG is an international management agency and mother agency managing models, stylists, photographers, and artists inside the fashion industry.</p>
									<p>Founded in 2019 the fashion management department represents true industry icons like Mari Malek and Alex Hace. Since the beginning, our agency has been fighting for more inclusivity and diversity inside the entertainment industry. </p>
									<p>Our mission is to advocate for uniqueness and diversity within the entertainment industry by promoting and connecting our clients to worlwide brands and casting directors. The lack of diversity inside this business motivated us to create a new and innovative management method.</p>
